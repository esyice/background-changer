# Background Changer App

## Description
The Background Changer App is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to dynamically change the background color of the webpage using RGB color values. Users can adjust the red, green, and blue components of the color through slider inputs, creating a personalized visual experience.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Background Color**: As users adjust the RGB values, the background color of the page updates in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features sliders for each color component (red, green, blue), making it easy for users to explore different color combinations.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built using a flexible layout, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing functionality and interactivity.

## How It Works
- The app maintains three state variables for the red, green, and blue color components using the `useState` hook.
- The `useEffect` hook is utilized to apply the RGB color value to the document's body background whenever any of the color components change.
- A custom `Range` component is used to create the sliders for each color, allowing users to set the values conveniently.

## Example Usage
1. Adjust the sliders for red, green, and blue to see how the background color changes in real-time.
2. Experiment with different combinations to create your desired background color.

## Future Improvements
- Add a color preview box to show the selected color before applying it.
- Allow users to save their favorite color combinations.
- Implement a reset button to return to the default background color.
